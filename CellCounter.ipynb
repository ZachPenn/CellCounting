    "# Instructions\n",
    "The following code was designed in order to calculate the number of cells within an image or set of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few pertinent features of the code:\n",
    "This code calculates the number of counted cells on up to two channels, as well as overlapping cells across channels.\n",
    "In addition to cell count, the locations of counted cells can be saved.\n",
    "Lastly, a region of interest based upon a user-made mask can be specified and cell counting can be restricted to this region of interest.  The size of the region of interest in pixels is returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Folder Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "For this code to work files should be organized in a specific manner.\n",
    "Directory_Main (the path of which is to be defined by the user... actual directory name can be whatever you want) should contain the subfolders \"Ch1\",\"Ch2\",\"ROI\", and \"SavedOutput\" (these names matter).\n",
    "If you are not using ROIs, this folder can be excluded.\n",
    "Similarly, if only one channel is being examined, Ch1/Ch2 can be exluded.\n",
    "Ch1 and Ch2 folders should contain .tif images with files of the same name, though some suffix identifying the channel (e.g. \"_Ch1\") is fine.  This is required in order for images for each channel of a multichannel image to be matched.\n",
    "ROI should contain .tif images with ROI masks, described below.  These should be named similarly to files in Ch1 and Ch2.\n",
    "Example filenames under Ch1, Ch2, and ROI: \"Mouse1_Image1_Ch1.tif\",\"Mouse1_Image1_Ch2.tif\",\"\"Mouse1_Image1_ROI.tif\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making ROIs\n",
    "Regions of interest are best drawn using ImajeJ.  Binary masks are created such that the region of interest pixel values = 255, whereas other values are equal to 0\n",
    "#1 - Open the image in ImageJ\n",
    "#2 - Use your preferred selection tool (I like freehand selection tool) to outline the region of interest\n",
    "#3 - Go to edit > selection > create mask\n",
    "#4 - Save the mask as .tif file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "The following will need to be installed in your Conda environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - python (3.6.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - imread\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - mahotas(1.4.4)\n",
    "\n",
    "5 - numpy(1.14.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "6 - pandas(0.23.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "7 - matplotlib(2.2.2). \n",
    "\n",
    "The following commands can be executed in your terminal to create the environment: \n",
    "\n",
    "conda config --add channels conda-forge\n",
    "\n",
    "conda create -n EnvironmentName python=3.6.5 mahotas=1.4.4 pandas=0.23.0 matplotlib=2.2.2 jupyter imread\n",
    "\n",
    "Different versions of these packages have not been tested.  Single channel .tif images are required (some image acquisition software exports single channel images with more than >2 dimensions.  If this is the case, images must first be converted to 2 dimensional space).  Images that are not already 8-bit are converted to 8 bit.  However, these images are not necessarily on a scale from 0-255.  It is therefore advised that all images are set to 8 bit before running this.  If this was not done, be sure that composite image running during optimization is of the exact same form.  Additionally, for measuring diameter this should be in pixel units.  To insure files are in pixel scale, in ImageJ go to Analyze -> SetScale -> Click to Remove Scale -> OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What type of cells can this count?\n",
    "Any semi-circular cell that is more or less filled by the fluorescent label will be cable of being counted.  If the cells are only visible by their perimeter than this code as is may not work. In this case, a process should be applied to either a) fill the internal component of the cell after thresholding or b) use smoothing or morphological opening to increase the internal of the cell. Although watershed can separate cells to some extent, a large degree ov overlap is unable to be overcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting parameters:\n",
    "All parameters required to be set by the user is set in the first cell of code.  \n",
    "1 - Cell Diameter:  This is the average cell diameter in pixel units.  Can be obtained easily with ImageJ measurement tool.\n",
    "2 - Threshold:  This is to be obtained using the optimization procedure or by setting by eye (not advised).\n",
    "3 - Paricle Minimum: After thresholding this serves to erase excessively small points.  Proportion of average cell size permitted.  Average cell size is assumed to be square of diamater for rough approximation\n",
    "4 - Use ROI:  Are you using an ROI or analyzing the entire image?\n",
    "5- Use Watershed: Watershed procedure attempts to separate adjoining cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing an example of how images are being processed\n",
    "In order to view what is being done to a single image on a single channel, one can go to the last cell, entitled \"Display Example Process for One Channel\".  To run this cell of code only the cells up to and including 'Get Directory Information' must be run\n"
