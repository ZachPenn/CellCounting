    "The following code was designed in order to calculate the fluorescent intensity for either an entire image or a region of interest (ROI) within an image based upon a user-made mask.  When an ROI is used, the size of the ROI in pixels is returned. When an ROI is not used, ROI size is set to size of image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Folder Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "For this code to work files should be organized in a specific manner.\n",
    "Directory_Main (the path of which is to be defined by the user... actual directory name can be whatever you want) should contain the subfolders \"ROI\", and \"SavedOutput\" (these names matter).  Additionally, there should be a folder with the images to measured.  The name of this folder can be specified by user\n",
    "If you are not using ROIs, this folder can be excluded.\n",
    "Image folder should contain .tif images. ROI should contain .tif images with ROI masks, described below.  These should be named similarly to files in image folder with the exception of some suffix.\n",
    "Example filenames under image folder and ROI: \"Mouse1_Image1_Ch1.tif\",\"\"Mouse1_Image1_ROI.tif\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making ROIs\n",
    "Regions of interest are best drawn using ImajeJ.  Binary masks are created such that the region of interest pixel values = 255, whereas other values are equal to 0\n",
    "#1 - Open the image in ImageJ\n",
    "#2 - Use your preferred selection tool (I like freehand selection tool) to outline the region of interest\n",
    "#3 - Go to edit > selection > create mask\n",
    "#4 - Save the mask as .tif file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "The following will need to be installed in your Conda environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - python (3.6.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - imread\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - mahotas(1.4.4)\n",
    "\n",
    "5 - numpy(1.14.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "6 - pandas(0.23.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "7 - matplotlib(2.2.2). \n",
    "\n",
    "The following commands can be executed in your terminal to create the environment: \n",
    "\n",
    "conda config --add channels conda-forge\n",
    "\n",
    "conda create -n EnvironmentName python=3.6.5 mahotas=1.4.4 pandas=0.23.0 matplotlib=2.2.2 jupyter imread\n",
    "\n",
    "Different versions of these packages have not been tested.  Single channel .tif images are required (some image acquisition software exports single channel images with more than >2 dimensions.  If this is the case, images must first be converted to 2 dimensional space).  Images that are not already 8-bit are converted to 8 bit.  However, these images are not necessarily on a scale from 0-255.  It is therefore advised that all images are set to 8 bit before running this. \n"
